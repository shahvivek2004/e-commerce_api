## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

prerequisites or dependencies that users need to have installed.

- Node.js
- npm/yarn
- Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   npm init
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

type below command in terminal:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

go to any rest client for e.g: postman and you can
implement any api endpoints with prefix:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```


   
## API Endpoints: 
**GET /categories:** Retrieve a list of categories.
**GET /products/:categoryId:** Retrieve products based on category ID.
**GET /products/:productid:** Retrieve products based on product ID.
**POST /cart/add:** Add a product to the user's cart.
**GET /cart/:userid:** View the contents of the user's cart.
**PUT /cart/update:** Update the quantity of a product in the user's cart.
**DELETE /cart/remove:** Remove a product from the user's cart.
**POST /order/place:** place an order
**GET /order/history:** get order history
**GET /order/details:** get order details
**POST /users/register:** Register a new user.
**POST /users/login:** Log in and obtain an authentication token.


## Authentication

### Overview

User authentication in this project is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWTs provide a secure and efficient way to authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources.

### How It Works

1. **User Registration:**
   - Users can register by providing a unique username, a secure password, and a valid email address.

2. **User Login:**
   - To authenticate, users send a POST request to the `/login` endpoint with their username and password.
   - Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT containing a user identifier and other relevant information.

3. **Token Generation:**
   - The server signs the JWT with a secret key to ensure its integrity.
   - The generated token is sent back to the client in the response.

4. **Token Usage:**
   - Subsequent API requests that require authentication should include the JWT in the `Authorization` header using the "Bearer" scheme.
   - Example: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjExLCJpYXQiOjE2NTU1MTQ2MTMsImV4cCI6MTY1NTUyMDIxM30.z-C5XXVeBt8LvsOV5DG9KQPIuNt2RH-YolD1eJXbfHI`

### Making Authenticated Requests

To make authenticated requests to protected API endpoints, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain a Token:**
   - Register or log in to get a JWT.
   - Store the token securely on the client side.

2. **Include Token in Requests:**
   - Include the token in the `Authorization` header of API requests using the "Bearer" scheme.
   - Example using cURL:
     ```bash
     curl -X GET \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjExLCJpYXQiOjE2NTU1MTQ2MTMsImV4cCI6MTY1NTUyMDIxM30.z-C5XXVeBt8LvsOV5DG9KQPIuNt2RH-YolD1eJXbfHI" \
       https://api.example.com/protected-endpoint
     ```

3. **Handling Token Expiry:**
   - Tokens have an expiration time (`exp` claim). If a request fails due to an expired token, obtain a new token by re-authenticating.

### Token Security

- **Keep Tokens Secure:**
  - Treat tokens like passwords; store and transmit them securely.
  
- **Use HTTPS:**
  - Always make API requests over HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and server.

### Example Code

```javascript
// Example code to include token in API request using Fetch
const apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com/protected-endpoint';
const token = 'your-token-here';

fetch(apiUrl, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```
